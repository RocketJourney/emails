# RJ Emails Repo
Handcoded HTMLs right now. No fancy gulp process, yet.

### What you need to know:

Theres a `<!-- config: "param name" -->` tag before the HTML that has to be configured with dynamic info or urls.

Theres a info.md file in each email folder, containing the Subject and Sender info for each mail.
